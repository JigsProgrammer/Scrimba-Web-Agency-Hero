# Scrimba Web Agency Hero
 This repository contains all the necessary files for the project Web Agency Hero on Scrimba.

In this project, I will be applying the following topics discussed under Scrimba's Space Exploration Site:
- Background images
- Webp format
- Google Fonts
- The <span> tag
- IDs & utility classes
- Text-shadow

Reflections and Realizations

This project was relatively easy for me to do, too. I still have the same realizations: media queries. But, I guess that's for another day for now.
